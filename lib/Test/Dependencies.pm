=head1 NAME

Test::Dependencies - Ensure that the dependency listing is complete

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.20

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.20';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your t/00-dependencies.t:

    use CPAN::Meta;  # or CPAN::Meta::cpanfile
    use File::Find::Rule::Perl;
    use Test::Dependencies exclude =>
      [qw/ Your::Namespace Some::Other::Namespace /];

    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('META.yml');
    die "No META.yml" if ! $meta;

    my @files =
       File::Find::Rule::Perl->perl_files->in('./lib', './bin');

    ok_dependencies($meta, \@files);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Makes sure that all of the modules that are 'use'd are listed in the
Makefile.PL as dependencies.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<DEPRECATED> You can pass options to the module via the 'use' line.
These options will be moved to the ok_dependencies() function.
The available options are:

=over 4

=item exclude

Specifies the list of namespaces for which it is ok not to have
specified dependencies.

=item style

Specifies the style of module usage checking to use.  There are two
valid values: "light" and "heavy".  The default is heavy.  The
light style uses regular expressions to try and guess which modules
are required.  It is fast, but can get confused by here-docs,
multi-line strings, data sections, etc.  The heavy style actually
compiles the file and asks perl which modules were used.  It is
slower than the light style, but much more accurate.  If you have a
very large project and you don't want to wait for the heavy style
every time you run "make test," you might want to try the light
style or look into the overrides below.

Whether a style is specified or not, the style used can be overriden
by the environment variable TDSTYLE.  This is useful, for example, if
you want the heavy style to be used normally, but don't want to take
the time checking dependencies on your smoke test server.

Example usage:

  use Test::Dependencies
    exclude => ['Test::Dependencies'],
    style => 'light';

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

=head2 ok_dependencies($meta, $files, $phases, $features, %options)

 $meta is a CPAN::Meta object
 $files is an arrayref with files to be scanned

=head3 %options keys

=over

=item phases

This is an arrayref holding one or more names of phases
as defined by L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>, or undef for all

=item features

This is an arrayref holding zero or more names of features, or undef for all

=item ignores

This is a hashref listing the names of modules (and their sub-namespaces)
for which no errors are to be reported.

=back

=head2 ok_dependencies()

B<Deprecated.> Legacy invocation to be removed. In previous versions,
this function would scan the I<entire> bin/, lib/ and t/ subtrees, with the
exception of a few sub-directories known to be used by version control
systems.

This behaviour has been changed: as of 0.20, Find::File::Rule::Perl
is being used to find Perl files (*.pl, *.pm, *.t and those starting with
a shebang line referring to perl).
